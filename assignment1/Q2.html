<h1>IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</h1>

<p>
 

Information technology (IT) is an integral part of every single business plan. 
Information technology plays a vital role in every business type including small, medium and large (multinational).
Information technology is used in companies to implement communication.
 Network (intranet and internet) and email play a key role in the organisational communication 
internally as well as externally. Today, organisational communication has been developed via chats and 
Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) and telephones (Curry, 2008).
 Inventory management systems will allow organisations to track stocks and activate an order of extra stock
 when the numbers drop below a pre-defined quantity. Companies connect the inventory management system to their
 Point-of-Sale (POS) systems to gain maximum efficiency.
